' this module was created for napster api programming, not winsock.
' it is the fix to the ocx file i released a while ago, which is 
' included in the zip file. with this module you can create progs
' for napster, as people created progs for aol. i included some ex
' of how to work the punt correctly, so you don't recieve a lag as
' the punter works. the code automatically closes the main window
' of the im. it also shows how to finger the user, using napster's
' finger option, get connection status, punt users, send a normal
' instant message, close napster, connect to napster, disconnect
' from napster, get error text, get normal text, kill error msgs,
' hide napster, show napster, kill toolbar, run menu item's etc.
' everyone who uses this has to promise to release a fixed ver.
' of this code, even if you added one or two routines. and atleast
' give me credit for my own work.
