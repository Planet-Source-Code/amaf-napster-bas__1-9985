### Description

the first ever napster.bas created. this module was created for napster api programming, not winsock. it is the fix to the ocx file i released a while ago, which is

included in the zip file. with this module you can create progs for napster, as people created progs for aol. i included some ex of how to work the punt correctly, so you don't recieve a lag as

the punter works. the code automatically closes the main window of the im. it also shows how to finger the user, using napster's finger option, get connection status, punt users, send a normal

instant message, close napster, connect to napster, disconnect from napster, get error text, get normal text, kill error msgs, hide napster, show napster, kill toolbar, run menu item's etc.

everyone who uses this has to promise to release a fixed ver. of this code, even if you added one or two routines. and atleast give me credit for my own work.
